"""Build the study app's CJK fonts from the ones already in Anki's media folder.

Mario's card template randomises the hanzi across five faces, and the five TTFs
are already sitting in `collection.media` as `_simsun.ttf` and friends. This
script turns those exact files into `.cpfont` files the device can read, so the
device randomises across the same five faces he has been reading in Anki.

    tools_local/study/make_fonts.py \
        --media ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Anki2/User\\ 1/collection.media \
        --deck /tmp/studytest/mandarin \
        --out /Volumes/SDCARD/.fonts

Needs fonttools and freetype-py. The repo keeps a venv for this:

    uv venv .venv-study && uv pip install --python .venv-study/bin/python fonttools freetype-py
    .venv-study/bin/python tools_local/study/make_fonts.py ...

## Two things this does that the stock converter does not

**Subsetting.** A full CJK face is ~21000 glyphs; this deck uses 2769. At the
headword size a glyph bitmap is the dominant cost, so rasterising the other
18000 would multiply the output by eight for characters Mario will never see.
The subset keeps the codepoints the deck actually contains, and the converter
emits an empty record for the rest -- which is what lets us keep using a single
broad interval, so the interval table that gets loaded into RAM stays tiny
while the waste stays on the SD card where it is free.

**Monochrome rasterisation.** `GfxRenderer.cpp:448` draws a pixel for any
non-zero coverage, so an antialiased edge floods to solid black: stems fatten,
counters close, and a twenty-stroke hanzi turns to mush. The obvious fix -- the
format is 2-bit, so collapse every sample to 0 or 3 and the renderer's test
becomes a real threshold -- was tried, shipped, and was wrong. U+4E00 (yi,
"one") is one thin horizontal stroke that the stock converter quantises to
*light* along its whole length, so a 50% cut erased it and 我有一百块钱
rendered as 我有 -百块钱: a different sentence.

No per-pixel rule could have worked, because the information was not in the
antialiased bitmap. It is in the outline. `mono_cpfont.py` rasterises through
FreeType with `FT_LOAD_TARGET_MONO`, so the hinter snaps each stem to a whole
pixel *before* rasterising -- which is what CJK bitmap fonts have always done.
Measured on SimSun at sentence size: U+4E00 goes from two fat rows (64 px of
ink) to one clean stroke with its serif (33 px), and 统 from 314 px to 243 with
its counters open.

`--antialiased` keeps the old path for comparison, and `--threshold` the old
mistake, because that comparison is how the mistake was found.

# every card drew empty -- and CJK Extension A, where a few thousand rare
# hanzi and kanji sit, was missing the same way. Meanwhile simply adding both

# inside an interval but absent from the subset still costs an empty 16-byte
# record on the card, and `hangul` alone is 11184 of them.
