"""Study, in two commands.

    ./tools_local/study/study.py setup     # once, or when you change deck
    ./tools_local/study/study.py sync      # after every session

That is the whole interface. Everything the computer can work out for itself,
it works out: where the Anki collection is, what decks are in it, where the SD
card is mounted, whether the fonts are already built. What it cannot know it
asks once and remembers.

The underlying tools (anki_to_deck.py, deck_to_anki.py, make_fonts.py) still
take explicit paths and still do exactly one thing each -- that is what makes
them testable, and this file is not a replacement for them. It is the layer
that means a person does not have to type a forty-character path with escaped
spaces to revise some flashcards.

Every prompt has a flag, so this is scriptable as well as interactive.
