"""Which writing system a character belongs to, and what that costs to draw.

One copy, imported by anki_to_deck.py and check_deck.py, because the two used
to carry the same `is_cjk` and the same hole in it.

The question this answers is not linguistic. It is: **does this character
need a face the deck has to ship, and is it drawn at full width?** Those two
together decide which glyph file it lands in, which font intervals get built,
and whether the wrap may break beside it.

The hole it exists to close: `is_cjk` tested 0x2E80-0x9FFF, 0xF900-0xFAFF and
0xFF00-0xFFEF. Hangul syllables live at 0xAC00-0xD7A3 and are in none of
them, so every Korean character was classified as Latin -- which routed it to
the built-in serif, which has 1070 glyphs and no Hangul. A Korean deck
converted with no error, no warning and no readable card. The same range
missed CJK Extension A (0x3400-0x4DBF), where a few thousand rare hanzi and
kanji live.

# brackets: " 漢字[かんじ]". The Japanese Support add-on generates whole
# fields in that form ("私[わたし]は 学生[がくせい]です"), and three template
# filters read them: {{furigana:}} draws the ruby, {{kanji:}} shows the base
# alone, {{kana:}} shows the readings alone.
#
# The leading space is part of the syntax and not part of the text: it is how
# Anki knows where the base begins, because a base is not delimited any other
# way. It is eaten, except where it separates two words that had a space
# between them anyway.

#
# Three markers rather than two, so a left-to-right parser knows a segment is
# coming BEFORE it reads the base. With only a separator and a terminator the
# device would have to scan ahead at every character to find out whether the
# run it is in is a base or ordinary text, which is exactly the work the wrap
# is trying not to do per glyph.
#
# Control characters, not brackets, and that is load-bearing. The obvious
# encoding is to leave Anki's own "漢字[かんじ]" in the field and parse it on
# the device -- and it collides head-on with cloze, whose question face is
# text with "[...]" in it: a hole would be read as a reading and the answer
# printed above the gap hiding it. None of these three can occur in a cleaned
# field, because clean() drops every character below space except the newline.
