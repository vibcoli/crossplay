"""Convert an Anki collection into an SD-card study deck.

    tools_local/study/anki_to_deck.py \

        --deck 'Mandarin: Vocabulary::Current' \
        --out /Volumes/SDCARD/study/mandarin

The format, and the reasoning behind it, is docs/apps/study-deck-format.md. This
script only writes; nothing here reads back from the device. Sync in the other
direction is deck_to_anki.py.

Reading Anki's collection directly (rather than an .apkg export) is deliberate:
the deck's FSRS parameters only exist in the live collection, and shipping a
deck without them would mean the device scheduling differently from the phone
on the very first review.

Scheduling state is taken wherever it survives. Older Anki cached each card's
FSRS memory state in cards.data ({"s":..,"d":..}) and that is used when
present; current Anki stores {"pos":..,"dr":..} instead and recomputes state
from the review log on demand, so this script does the same, replaying each
card's own reviews through fsrs.py (the mirror of the device scheduler).
Without that fallback a collection written by current Anki converts every
reviewed card as brand new -- found 2026-08-25 on a deck with 6300 reviews.
