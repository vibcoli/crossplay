# What is in docs/

Two owners share this directory, and the split is deliberate.

**Upstream's reference docs keep upstream's filenames**, so merges from
CrossPoint stay cheap: `activity-manager.md`, `comparison.md`, `dictionary.md`,
`file-formats.md`, `fix-bricked-xteink.md`, `focus-reading.md`,
`hyphenation-trie-format.md`, `i18n.md`, `plugin-events.md`, `sd-card-fonts.md`,
`sd-plugins.md`, `translators.md`, `troubleshooting.md`, `webserver*.md`,
`contributing/` and `images/`. The two plugin docs arrived with upstream's SD
plugin system in the 2026-09-30 sync.

`crosspoint-readme.md` is the exception to the naming rule: it is upstream's
README, moved here when the fork took the `README.md` filename, and its
internal links were re-based when it moved.

`comparison.md` is upstream's too, and it is a snapshot rather than a current
statement: it compares a named CrossPoint version against the stock XTOS
firmware, says nothing about this fork, and nothing updates it. Read it as
history.

**A shared filename is not a byline, and this paragraph used to claim it was.**
It said those files were "untouched", and several are not. The fork has edited
`activity-manager.md`, `i18n.md`, `translators.md`, `troubleshooting.md`,
`webserver.md` and `webserver-endpoints.md` at the root, plus most of
`contributing/`. Keeping upstream's name is a merge decision, not an authorship
claim. Ask git rather than reading a list that goes stale:

```bash
# verbatim upstream, upstream's file with fork edits, or ours alone?
f=docs/i18n.md
git cat-file -e crosspoint/develop:"$f" 2>/dev/null \
  && { [ "$(git rev-parse crosspoint/develop:"$f")" = "$(git rev-parse HEAD:"$f")" ] \
       && echo "upstream, verbatim" || echo "upstream's file, edited here"; } \
  || echo "this fork's"
```

`contributing/` is worth naming file by file, because it is the directory a
newcomer opens on instinct and it is no longer upstream's alone:

| File                         | Who wrote it                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `getting-started.md`         | **rewritten for this fork.** Upstream's version cloned the wrong repository and built the wrong chip |
| `landing-and-integration.md` | **this fork's.** No upstream counterpart                                                             |
| `development-workflow.md`    | upstream's, with fork edits (branch, checks, where a PR goes)                                        |
| `testing-debugging.md`       | upstream's filename, almost entirely fork content now                                                |
| `README.md`                  | upstream's, index extended                                                                           |
| `architecture.md`            | upstream's, one link re-pointed                                                                      |
| `touch-and-ui.md`            | upstream's, verbatim                                                                                 |

`host-tests/docsclaims/` holds that table to the repository: every row is
checked against `crosspoint/develop`, so a row that stops being true is a test
failure rather than something the next reader has to notice.

**The fork's cross-cutting docs also live at the root**: how to build an app
(`building-apps.md`), how it should look (`design-language.md`), what the
project is (`identity.md`), the shelf contract (`shelf.md`), the two real
buttons (`buttons.md`), what scale does to games (`games-at-scale.md`), how to
reflash and inspect a device over Wi-Fi with no cable
(`developer-mode.md`), how the two open bridges are attacked and defended
(`bridge-security.md`), what is knowingly unfinished (`open-items.md`), and one
standing proposal about where the fork's files live on the card
(`crossplay-data-root.md`), which is a question rather than a decision.

Four more are narrower but no less load-bearing, and this paragraph did not
name any of them until the suite started asking: what the glass hides
(`bezel-insets.md`), the unbounded build cache that fails builds by filling
the disk (`build-cache.md`), the pixel budget an unwrapped string has in 32
languages (`i18n-overflow.md`), and where Trivia's questions come from
(`trivia-curation.md`).

**Two files, and only one of them is published.** `release-body.md` is what a
tag publishes, and it is deliberately tiny: one line of links, then this
release's `### What is new in <version>` block. Nothing else. It describes
neither the project nor how to install it, because `README.md`, `install.md`
and the site all already do and a release page that repeats them is a release
page nobody finishes. `release-notes.md` is the history, newest first, and
nothing publishes it. They were one file until 2026-09-04, which is why
v1.12.21's release page ran to 20,402 characters and carried six earlier
releases under "What WAS new in ...".

Neither is written by hand. `scripts_local/release_notes.py` rewrites the block
in the body and prepends the same block to the history; `scripts_local/ship.sh`
commits both, on Mario's Mac, before the build that ships (the version is
compiled into the firmware, so the order is load-bearing). Edit the tooling, not the files -- except the body's
one standing line of links, which is prose and is left alone by the generator.
`host-tests/release` holds the body to a size ceiling and refuses install steps
on it; growing it back is a test failure, not a judgement call.

Only landings a person could receive something different from become notes, and
the question is put to `scripts_local/device-build-needed.sh --ships` -- the
same column of the same table `release-needed.sh` uses to decide whether to
release at all, asked rather than copied. That table carries two independent
attributes per path prefix, `builds` and `ships`, because the two questions have
opposite risk profiles: a wrong "build" costs runner minutes, a wrong "release"
puts an update prompt on every device in the field. While one predicate answered
both, `.gitignore` cut v1.12.21 (live for a build, invisible to a release) and a
fix to `crossplay-release.yml` was invisible to both (card #190). A path in no
row of the table is not guessed at: the build runs and says so, and the release
question REFUSES, naming the path.

`ships` has three values, not two, because "cut a release" and "put a line on
the page" are two more questions that were sharing one answer. `yes` is a change
in the thing a person uses. `quiet` is a change only in how the release was
packaged -- `scripts_local/ship.sh`, the one thing that uploads what anybody
downloads, and `.github/workflows/crossplay-release.yml` before it was deleted
on 2026-09-21. A `quiet` landing cuts a release exactly like a `yes` one, and
it earns a bullet only if its pull request wrote a `What is new:` line, because
packaging prose is written for developers and the page is read by players. CI
used to ask for that line at pull-request time; with no pull-request run left
to ask, the person who knows what changed writes it in the description and
`release_notes.py` reads it there.

The excluded landings are named in ship.sh's output and nowhere else.
They used to be a trailing bullet -- "Plus 4 changes nothing on the device can
see." -- which is itself a line a player cannot act on, on a page written for
players. A sync's notes come from its body, which lists the upstream commit
subjects, rather than from a title that only counts them.

This text is read on the GitHub release page. The device never shows it: it
parses `tag_name` and the asset's name, url and size, and the update screen
draws two version numbers. What a device raises is "there is a release".

`install.md` is the reader-facing one: everything about getting the firmware
onto a device except the one-click browser install, which stays on the front
page because it is what almost everybody wants. It exists so the README does
not have to carry esptool invocations, the update-an-existing-install rules and
Developer Mode's pairing flow above the fold.

`developer-mode.md` covers a runtime setting and the routes it exposes. It is a
fork doc rather than a section in upstream's `webserver-*.md` because those stay
untouched so merges from CrossPoint stay cheap.

**Everything about one app lives in [apps/](apps/)**, named after its
directory in `src/apps_local/` (`dungeon.md` for the app the shelf calls
D&Diagrams, `connectfour.md`, `chess.md`). Auxiliary records keep a
qualifying suffix (`study-deck-format.md`, `xkcd-viewing-plan.md`). Not every
app has a doc; one earns a doc when something about it would be rediscovered
the hard way otherwise.

**How the work itself is run lives in [workflow/](workflow/)**: the board and
its cards, the orchestrator's runbook, the contract every worker session holds
to, and the record of what Mario himself reported as against what our own side
found. It is the directory that answers "who found this", which the rest of
these docs assume rather than state.

**Who found what, everywhere in `docs/`.** A **critic**, a **critic agent** or a
**cold agent** is an LLM session with no builder context, not a person.
`games-at-scale.md` defines that loop. Where a person found something the docs
say a person, and `open-items.md` is the record of what people found. These
files are also written _to_ Mario rather than _by_ him, which is why they say
"Mario's rule" and not "my rule": a decision credited to him is one he made.
