// that way, so a laptop can build a screen against a fake draw target and ask
// what it drew and what it made tappable.
//
// This is the half of the app that used to be untestable. The chess *rules* had
// 2940 assertions and the screens had none, which was backwards: the rules are
// stable and the screens change every time Mario asks for something. Two real
// bugs this file would have caught the day they were written are pinned below.

// What Mario reported twice: content sitting on the header. The header work

// starts, and a dozen of them decided it from toybox::kHeaderHeight, a constant
// that names the black band and knows nothing about the rule drawn under it.
//
// So this is not a per-screen test. A per-screen test is the thing that failed:
// it covers the screen you thought of, and Mario opens the other one. It lives
// in ~Rendered, so EVERY screen this suite renders is measured -- including the
// ones written after this comment by someone who never read it.
//
// The rule: the chrome owns rows 0..kChromeHeight (the band, the gap, the
// rule), and the first content pixel below it clears kGutter. That is the same
// number card #295 gave the Yahtzee dice, so this is the fork's own answer to
// "how far must content clear the header" applied everywhere rather than once.
// A screen may still draw INSIDE the band -- folder marks, medal tallies, face
// doors -- and those are placed by bandCenterY()/headerInkRect() on purpose.
//
// Text is measured as INK, not as its line box. A run's rect is the box the
// text was given and the glyphs sit inset within it (see inkTopIn), so
// measuring the rect would report collisions the eye cannot see and move type
// that already clears.
//
// KNOWN UNDERSTATEMENT, and it points the wrong way: inkBandOf resolves a cut
// through cutForSlot, which knows the three Jersey cuts and nothing else. The
// readers rebind their slots -- readingChromeFaces() puts the UI cut in the
// SMALL slot -- so a SMALL-slot run in reader chrome is measured against
// kTileCut when kUiCut drew it, and the probe puts its ink about five pixels
// LOWER than the truth. Nothing is close enough for that to matter today
// (Hacker News and Instapaper start 24px clear of the floor), but the margin is
// what protects them, not this check. A probe that resolved the cut from the
// theme actually in force would close it.

// The band a render actually painted, or 0. Taken from the paint rather than
// from kHeaderHeight, because the band is a THEME token and Solitaire raises
// it: a probe keyed to the constant would measure that screen against a line

// A magazine feature's worth of prose, built rather than pasted so the cost
// can be asked at more than one length.
//
// Deliberately NON-REPEATING. A corpus built by rotating a handful of
// sentences wraps periodically, and a wrap read from the WRONG offset then
// lands on a line identical to the right one -- so a staleness test compares
// two different answers, gets the same text back, and passes because it cannot
// tell them apart. That happened here: the kerning test below was green

// headerBand() calls absoluteChrome() before it takes the band, so the band
// paints from row 0 and its bottom edge lands at kHeaderHeight whatever the
// bezel hides -- testTheBandIsAbsoluteWithoutBeingAsked above pins exactly
// that. The ten covered rows are therefore already inside the band's paint,
// and a screen that adds safeArea.top to a chrome-derived top pushes its body
// ten pixels below every other app's and buys nothing.
//
// xkcd and Wallpapers did, for as long as both apps had existed, and the
// comment above each constant claimed it lined up with the shelf. NOTHING
// here could see it: every other test in this file builds against device(),
// whose safeArea is empty, and twice nothing is nothing. That absent coverage
// is the defect card 358 was really about, so the checks come in two parts:
// the alignment (all four apps on one row) and the rule that keeps it (the
// glass may not move a body top), the second of which a screen written
// tomorrow cannot pass by accident.

// Every row a screen's own content occupies: the y of everything drawn at or
// below kChromeHeight, which is where headerBand()'s ownership ends.
//
// The WHOLE list, sorted, not just the topmost. Comparing only the first row
// would pass a screen whose first element is absolute and whose later ones add
// safe.y -- and half a screen compensating is exactly the shape this fork keeps
// shipping (see the two-input-paths notes). Sorted rather than positional
// because draw order is not layout order.
//
// Rects rather than ink bands on purpose. toybox::inkCentred() expands a text
// rect around its cut, so a recorded rect can start above the band it was laid
// into -- xkcd's menu headline draws at y=102 for a band at 112. That expansion
// is identical in both contexts, so it cancels in a comparison and would only
// mislead an absolute assertion. The absolute row is asserted from the exported
// geometry instead, in testEveryAppsBodyStartsOnTheSameRow.
