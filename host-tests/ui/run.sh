# from jaipur down are compiled here for that warning alone -- no strict
# suite built them, so the class had nowhere to be caught in them at all.

# The flag is NOT the gate for this class, though -- host-tests/fmtwidth is.
# -Wformat-truncation is a middle-end warning and every suite here compiles
# at -O0, where it reports nothing at all. See host-tests/fmtwidth/check_widths.py.
