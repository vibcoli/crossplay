"""Build the converted deck the study host tests parse.

WHY THIS EXISTS. test_deck.cpp and test_images.cpp were written to read a deck
produced by the real converter, and they were right to be: a synthetic writer
beside our own reader agrees with itself about a format neither of them owns.
But nothing in check.sh or in CI ever produced one, so both tests took their
"no converted deck, skipping" branch on every run this repo has ever had, and
printed `PASS (0 checks, 0 failures)`. Two of the study app's five binaries
were an empty slot wearing the word PASS.

So the deck is built here, from a synthetic ANKI COLLECTION rather than from
synthetic deck.dat bytes. That distinction is the whole point:

    this file writes  ->  a schema-18 sqlite collection
    anki_to_deck.py   ->  deck.dat / meta.dat / cards.dat   (the real converter)
    StudyDeck.cpp     ->  reads them back                   (the real firmware)

Only the first step is ours. The format itself is written by the tool that
writes Mario's own decks and read by the code the device runs, so the round
trip the tests were written for actually happens.

Standard library only, on purpose. make_fixture_apkg.py builds far better
fixtures with Anki's own exporter, and needs the `anki` package in a venv;
CI has python and nothing else, and a fixture generator that CI cannot run
puts the tests straight back to skipping.

    host-tests/study/make_fixture.py --out DIR

Writes DIR/deck.dat, meta.dat, cards.dat, revlog.dat, .glyphs-*.txt and
images.dat.
